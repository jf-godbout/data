# Canadian Parliament Voting Records

#Last update: March 15, 2018

How to cite: 

**Godbout, Jean-François and Bjørn Høyland. 2017. Canadian Parliament Voting Data, 1867-2015. Compiled by Jean-François Godbout, University of Montreal. Political Science Department. 

Scope of study:

Each file contains the results of all of the votes (divisions) recorded by the Hansards Journals in each parliament since Confederation. The files are organized by parliament (1st to 40th). The votes are organized by dates, and by the voting records of members. I also have the 41st and 42nd (1 session) data if you need it (but with MP names, riding, and party only). However, it’s in a different format (you can download directly the votes from the Parliamentary website).

To get the election results, use the Election Canada data file and match on election year (date) and riding code with the file : Elections-1867-2015.csv 
*Warning* matching the voting data with the election data by riding name, last-name, first-name, date of election, is the best way to go. But you will get some errors, as some MPs and candidates have the same name in the same election/riding, and by-elections can sometimes pause a problem.  

Finally, I have another data-file (not in the folder) with the description of each recorded division (sponsor, type of bill, motion, origin government-private member, topic, etc.). I’m happy to share this as well, but we should talk about collaborating if you want to use this data.

Coding of the votes: yes=1;no=2;paired=3;yes+no=4;yes+paired=5;no+paired=6;yes+no+paired=7;abstain (Senate only)=8,not-vote=9;no-sitting=99 (member is not sitting in the House);error=9999

Riding: From the History of Federal Ridings Parliament data-file

Parliament.no: 1-40	

Term: Dates in which the member was elected to the House in the current parliament, or affiliated with a specific political party. Thus, members who switch parties, or who are expelled have different term length. 

Id.2: A code to identify each specific member of the House of Commons. Members who switch party, or become independent, take a new value each time their status changes in the House, e.g. A member who left the Liberal Party in a parliament, first to sit as an independent, and than later to join the Conservative Party would be coded as follow: 1010 (Liberal), 1010.1 (independent), 1010.2 (joined the Conservatives).

Id: This is the html item tag from the Canadian Parliament Parliamentarian file for each member elected to the House found in the PARLINFO website. This code is no longer used by the PARLINFO. Chris Cochrane at UofT has a matching file (old and new codes).
